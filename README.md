Hi !

I have explained these two functions & their uses in the following manner 

a. what are these functions ?
b. How it works & its usecase?
c.Its key features and Use cases 
d.Advantages and disadvantages of these functions 

1. Everything about _safeMint Function :)
   a. This is an important functions used in NFT (Non-Fungible Token) smart contract development, typically when working with ERC-721 standards on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
      This is a function used to create (mint) new NFTs in a safe manner. It's an extension of the basic _mint function with additional safety checks.
   b. It works by assigning new token to the given ID. It assigns ownership to the specified address.
   c. - It checks the recipient address , if it is found valid it can recieves ERC721 tokens
      - Prevents accidental locking of tokens in contracts that don't know how to handle them
      - Emits a Transfer event
      - It mints new NFT's and also helps in distribution of it
   d. Safer than basic _mint as it prevents tokens being stuck in contracts 
      Slightly more gas expensive than _mint

HERE IS THE CODE TO EXPLAIN THE SAME 
function makeNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    _safeMint(to, tokenId); // This is Safe minting with receiver check hence everything is secured
}

2. Everything about _setTokenURI Function :)
   a.  This is an important functions used in NFT (Non-Fungible Token) smart contract development, typically when working with ERC-721 standards on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
       it connects metadata with a specific NFT token ID
   b.  Takes a token ID and a URI string as input
       Stores the URI in the contract's storage
       Makes the URI retrievable via the tokenURI() function
   c.  -these store IPFS hashes or normal HTTP/HTTPS URLs
       -URI points to a JSON file with metadata stds.
       -It is used in Updating NFTs metadata (if permitted in contract rules)
   d. It can point to any URI scheme & gives a rich NFT experience which is an advantage

   HERE IS THE CODE TO EXPLAIN THE SAME 
function mintNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId, string memory tokenURI) public {
    _safeMint(to, tokenId); // First, create the NFT safely
    _setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI); // Then connect it with metadata
}

A full solidity contract will explain even better 

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract CryptoGoddess is ERC721 {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
    
    constructor() ERC721("CryptoGoddess", "GODDESS") {}
    
    function mintGoddess(address goddessOwner, string memory goddessURI) 
        public 
        returns (uint256) 
    {
        _tokenIds.increment();
        uint256 newGoddessId = _tokenIds.current();
        
        // Safely mint to prevent accidents
        _safeMint(goddessOwner, newGoddessId);
        
        // Dress her up with stunning metadata
        _setTokenURI(newGoddessId, goddessURI);
        
        return newGoddessId;
    }
}


HOPE THIS HELPS :)
